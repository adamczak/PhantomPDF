# PhantomPDF

####Create PDFs from urls using PhantomJS

####Motivation

How can I print this?  Can you put headers/footers on this when it prints?  Page numbers?  Can we ensure formatting of this page when printed?  Can you replicate this government form?  How do I save this as a PDF? 

PhantomPDF was created to answer these questions.  It was a "how about if we tried this?" that got used over and over again.
